# Jonas' attempt at the "Advent of Code" challenges.
All challenges fromt the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges were completed in the [Racket Programming Language](https://racket-lang.org). I wrote a custom parser that is able to convert the puzzle data from a textfile to a Racket list.
